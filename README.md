# First OpenAI API Call

## 📌 What the Script Does

This script demonstrates a simple interaction with OpenAI's `gpt-3.5-turbo` model using a fixed system prompt and a user-provided input. It:

- Takes a user prompt via the console.
- Uses a fixed system prompt (`"You are a helpful assistant."`).
- Calls the OpenAI API with both prompts.
- Prints the assistant’s response.
- Displays token usage (prompt tokens, completion tokens, and total tokens).
